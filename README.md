# Blackjack

Blackjack_01 was an enriching experience as it was one of my very first instances with game logic.

Blackjack_02 was my first project where I had implemented my knowledge of Object Oriented Programming. I had also formatted my code better compared to the previous version and also added another feature where players can now bet.

Blackjack_03 was my first project where I had dabbled in turtle graphics. It is one of my projects that I am very proud of as it took me countless hours to make it. I am almost done with this project but it seems there are still a few bugs in rendering the cards.
